Department of Humanities
and Social Sciences

Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences has been an integral part of the Institute since its inception in the year
2010. The main objective of the department is the holistic and all round development of the technical graduates into socially
responsible individuals. There has been strong exhortation and sensible view among the technical institutes that technical
education needs to be complemented by a vital appreciation of the social values and interpersonal context of all learning.
Responding to this eminent viewpoint, the department is infusing the concept of “Technology for the greater good of mankind
and society as a whole” so that the students will not only excel in technical expertise but also inculcate among themselves
excellence in communication, refinement of reasoning, openness to new ideas, and a commitment to social values and ethical
behaviour.

The department strives to provide the students allied knowledge essential to engineering students and offers subjects like
English Language Skills; Foundations of Management; Accounting and Financial Methods; Professional Ethics; and Introduction
to Economics. The Department also offers a PhD Programme under which research scholars are admitted twice a year.

Along with state of the art classrooms, the department is equipped with a modern Computer Assisted Language Learning
Laboratory.
