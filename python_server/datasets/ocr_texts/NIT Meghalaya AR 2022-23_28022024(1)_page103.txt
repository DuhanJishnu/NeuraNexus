Department of Electrical Engineering

1. Brief Introduction to the
Department:

The Department of Electrical Engineering started since the
inception of NIT Meghalaya. Presently the department offers
B.Tech, M.Tech and Ph.D. Programs. The B. Tech program started
in 2010 with an intake of 30 students at NIT Surat and from
2014 onward M.Tech program has been started with an intake of
20 students offering specialization in Power & Energy Systems.
Presently there are full-time and part-time research scholars,
registered for the Ph.D. program in diverse specializations. The
Department aims to impart high-quality education to the students
and carry out fundamental and industry-oriented research work.
The research interest of faculties encompasses various areas

of electrical engineering such as Power system Control, Smart
Grid Technology, Synchrophasor Technology, Power Quality and
Renewable energy integration to the grid, Power Electronics &
Drives, Control Systems and Instrumentation, Signal Processing
and Biomedical Instrumentation, High Voltage Engineering, etc.
The department has well-equipped laboratory facilities for the
students such as Basic Electrical Engineering Lab, Electrical
Machine Lab, Network and Systems Lab, Digital Electronics Lab,

3. Faculty Profile:

Power System Lab, Computational Lab, Control & Instrumentation
Lab, Power Electronics Lab, Electric Drives Lab, Microprocessor
Lab, Microcontroller & Embedded Systems Lab. Specialized
simulation software like Matlab, Sincal, FLUX, PSPICE, PSIM,
PSS@E, EMYP etc. is available with the department to carry

out experiments and research activities. Besides, the faculty of
the EE department is very actively publishing papers in reputed
journals and conferences such as IEEE, IET, Elsevier, Springer,
Taylor and Francis, Wiley, etc. Moreover, faculty members of the
EE department have received several sponsored research projects
from various agencies like SERB-DST, CPRI, REC, and the State
Council of Science Technology & Environment (SCSTE, Govt. of
Meghalaya).
