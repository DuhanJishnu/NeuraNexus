Provided a deep knowledge how the Al is generating some key features in space
technologies.

Autonomous spacecraft: Al enables autonomous decision- making and navigation
for spacecraft, reducing reliance on ground control and enabling more efficient
and agile operations. Al algorithms can analyze data from onboard sensors, make
real-time adjustments to spacecraft trajectories, and even perform complex tasks
such as docking and rendezvous with other spacecraft.
