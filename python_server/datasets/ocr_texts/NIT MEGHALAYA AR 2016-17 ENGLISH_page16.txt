Studentsâ€™ Placement:

Placement activities are an integral part of National Institute of Technology Meghalaya (NIT Meghalaya) and the activities were
carried out during the year by a Placement Committee. The objective of the Committee is to make each and every student of NIT
Meghalaya a success story and to impart legendary leadership qualities to all the students. It not only ensures that the graduation
outcome of the student is a fruitful and upright one, but also ensures that the students develop into a complete human being
with the perfect combination of professional and business ethics while still maintaining the values within themselves. The
Committee is privileged to generate manpower resources for both the domestic and global economic growth engine over the years
by functioning as a vital bridge between the students of the institute and the industries.
