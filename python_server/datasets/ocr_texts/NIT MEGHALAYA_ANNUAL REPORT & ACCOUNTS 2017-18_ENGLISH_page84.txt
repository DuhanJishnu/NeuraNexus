This was implemented during the semester from January-May 2018, where every engineering department selected one course
(3rd year level onwards) from the available pool of online courses under NPTEL, and asked all the students to enroll for the
courses. The faculty members of NIT Meghalaya conducted the mid-semester and laboratory seesions for the courses (where
applicable), and credit transfer was carried out as per academic rules of the Institute.

3. From the department of Civil Engineering, NIT Meghalaya, one student Ambuj Shandilya topped the NPTEL examination
(within top 2%) on “Sustainable Engineering Concepts and Life Cycle Analysis”, securing 86% marks. Two more students from
Civil Engineering Department, Khrawboklang Kharsyiemiong and Shivam Kumar, also became toppers (within top 5%) securing
83% and 82% marks respectively.

4. The studio is regularly being used to conduct short-term courses, seminars and lectures organized by the Institute.

It has been planned to start using the studio from the current semester (July-December 2018) to create in-house course
contents, through active participation of the faculty members of NIT Meghalaya. It is planned to develop at least one course
module from each Department of the Institute. The archive thus created can be reused in the future, both by students and
faculty members of NIT Meghalaya, and also of other neighboring Institutes.
