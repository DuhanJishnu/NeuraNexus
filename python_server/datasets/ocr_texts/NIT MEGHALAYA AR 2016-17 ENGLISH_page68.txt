Department of Mathematics

Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Mathematics was established in 2012 with the inception of National Institute of Technology Meghalaya.
The department offers Ph.D. and 2 year-M.Sc. programme in Mathematics. The department also supports all the engineering
departments by offering undergraduate and postgraduate level courses in mathematics to the B.Tech and M. Tech students
over a number of semesters. The department has been organizing workshops and summer internship programmes for students
and research scholars. The department has at present seven regular faculty members and one adjunct faculty. The faculties
are actively engaged in research, teaching and training. The main objective of the department is to attract students of science
and engineering, and to provide them academically coherent programmes, with courses that range from the fundamental to the
advanced. The department is likely start a 5-year joint B.Sc. and M.Sc. programme in near future.
