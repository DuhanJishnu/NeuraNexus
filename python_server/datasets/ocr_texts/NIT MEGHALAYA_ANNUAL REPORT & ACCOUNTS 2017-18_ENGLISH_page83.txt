Centre for Technology
Enabled Learning

The fantastic growth of information and communication technology (ICT) over the last few decades has changed almost every
aspect of our daily life. With the technology having become affordable and spreading to every geographic corner of our nation, it is
imperative that we exploit the same in the most befitting fashion. In order to maximize the impact on our society, it is necessary
to focus our attention to spreading quality education, both engineering and otherwise, to reach the masses. As part of a national
initiative from the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the present endeavor has been mainly towards providing the required
infrastructure and connectivity to the institutions of higher education like IITs and NITs. The objective is to create and manage a
rich pool of digital online resources and utilize them to provide quality certification programmes and courses, which can be used by
the universities, individuals, as well as government and non-government organizations.

The Centre for Technology-Enabled Learning (CTEL) was set up at NIT Meghalaya in June 2017, with the primary vision to become
the gateway for the north-eastern parts of the country to achieve the goals of the national mission. The centre is based around a
state-of-the-art video recording studio, with facilities for both content creation and content distribution. Using the infrastructure
available in this studio, faculty members of NIT Meghalaya and also the neighboring Institutes can participate in developing course
contents and directly assist in national initiatives like NPTEL and SWAYAM. The contents as developed can also be used by the
local students as offline resources for learning as per their own time schedule and convenience.

Since the creation of the centre, the following activities have been taken up that includes the setting up of a state-of-the-art
recording studio.

1. A recording studio has been set up with the following facilities:
a) Smart board as teaching aid with online recording facility.

b) Video recording facility with cameras, audio microphones, large-screen displays with online recording.
