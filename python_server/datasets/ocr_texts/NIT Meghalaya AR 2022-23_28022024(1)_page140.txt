1. Brief Introduction to the work. The main objective of the department is to attract the

Depa rtment: students of science and engineering, and to provide them with
academically coherent programmes, with courses that range from
the fundamental to the advanced. The department has a FIST
sponsored mathematics laboratory with computers, workstation
equipped with software such as MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, etc.
to facilitate faculty, students for their research and laboratory-
oriented courses.

The Department of Mathematics was established in 2012 with
the inception of National Institute of Technology Meghalaya.
The department offers Ph.D. and 2 year-M.Sc. programmes in
Mathematics. The department also supports all the engineering
departments by offering undergraduate and postgraduate level
courses in Mathematics to the B. Tech., M. Tech., and Ph.D.
students over a number of semesters. The department has been 2. Prog rammes Offered:
organizing seminars and summer internship programs for students ° 2-year M. Sc. programme

and research scholars. The department has at present six regular

faculty members and one adjunct professor. The faculties are * Ph. D. programme
