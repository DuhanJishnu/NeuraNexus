Chemistry

1. Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya has started in 2012. In addition to the B.Tech. Chemistry
course, the department is also offering 2 yrs M.Sc. program in Chemistry from 2015 onwards with all the major areas of Chemistry
such as Inorganic, Organic, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry. The intake capacity of M.Sc. program is sixteen (16).

Currently, it is offering Ph.D. programs in broad area of Chemical Sciences like Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Biophysical
Chemistry, Materials Chemistry and Computational Chemistry. Presently, the department has total twelve (12) Ph.D. students
working in various thrust areas.

The department has total 6 faculty members including one DST-INSPIRE faculty. The faculty members are involved in quality
research works apart from their regular teaching and administrative works.

The M.Sc. Students of the department are encouraged to apply for summer-internship programmes in various reputed institutes
and universities of the country.

The department is attracting students from various other institutes and universities for M.Sc. and Ph.D. programmes in view of
the concepts of interdisciplinary teaching and research for the advancement in the fields of organic materials, nanoscience and
technology, biological chemistry etc.
