Department of Physics

1. Brief Introduction to the
Department:
The Department of Physics was established in 2012 and

comprised 6 faculty, 2 non-teaching staff members, and 32
Ph.D. scholars. The Department of Physics, with its induction,

has evolved by offering two years full-time M.Sc Physics program.

The department has also progressed in furnishing the Doctor of
Philosophy program, and so far, the degree has been awarded

to 5 nos. of aspirants. In addition, the department supports the
engineering branches of the institute by floating the foundation
courses for B.Tech (1 year) and advanced science electives
courses like Quantum Computing and Nanoelectronics. The DST

3. Faculty Profile:

supports the department under the FIST Scheme, Government of
India. Under this scheme, Department has developed sophisticated
instruments like RF/DC sputtering and Raman spectroscopy at the
NITM Sohra campus with a class 100 clean room facility. Faculty
members working within Theory and Experimental Condensed
Matter Physics, Applied Optics, Nuclear & Particle Physics, and
Smart Materials. The department has over 200 peer-reviewed
articles and 7 projects from various funding agencies.
