Networking & Bug Bounty:

Date : 12-10-2022(9-12pm)
Lecture Hall by Rohit Patedar Viraj Vaishnav
Total Attendance :25

Both networking and bug bounty programs are essential in the
field of computer science and cybersecurity. Networking enables
effective communication and data exchange, while bug bounty
programs contribute to the ongoing improvement of software and
system security.

Networking: It explain how the computer are connected to each
other and It involves understanding concepts like IP addressing,
routing, switching, TCP/IP, DNS, and network topologies.

Bug Bounty: Bug bounty programs in computer science and
cybersecurity involve the identification and reporting of software
vulnerabilities and security flaws. Ethical hackers participate in
these programs to find and report bugs to software companies,
web platforms, or organizations. In return, they receive monetary
rewards, recognition, or other incentives.

Competetive Coding:

Date : 09-11-2022(10-12pm)
New CC by : Ritikmani Yadav and Keshav Krishna
Total Attendance : 20

Competitive coding competitions and platforms provide a range
of coding challenges that test problem-solving skills, algorithmic
knowledge, and programming proficiency. Participants compete
against each other to solve these challenges and achieve the best
possible solution within the given constraints.

They teach student how to use different platform to solve question
regarding coding; also helped student in solving some of the
question from leetcode and completed the lecture.

They at last teach how codes for Digit code are generated and
some mathematics involved like permutation and combination.

Bug bounty programs encourage security researchers to discover
and report vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious
actors. This helps improve the security of software, websites, and
applications, ensuring that potential weaknesses areidentified and
fixed promptly.
