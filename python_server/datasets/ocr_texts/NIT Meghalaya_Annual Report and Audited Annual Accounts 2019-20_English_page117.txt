CENTRE FOR TECHNOLOGY
ENABLED LEARNING

BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE CTEL:

The fantastic growth of Information technology (IT) over the last few decades has changed almost every part of our daily
life. In order to exploit the technology to benefit our society in a major way, it is necessary to devote time and attention
to engineering, expansion, as well as spreading of quality education in related areas. As part of a national initiative from
the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the present endeavor has been mainly towards providing the required
infrastructure and connectivity to the institutions of higher education like IITs and NITs. The objective is to create and
manage a rich pool of digital resources and utilize them to provide quality certification programme and courses, which can
be used by the universities as well as government and non-government organizations.

In its quest to make quality higher education accessible to the masses, the Government of India has been very keen to use the
technological resources that are being developed to achieve the mission.As a major step in this direction, it had launched the
National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (NMEICT) in 2009 to allow eminent
teachers and experts in the country to pool their collective wisdom for the benefit of every Indian individual who is willing
to learn. This will greatly help in reducing the digital divide, which has traditionally plagued our society. In addition to quality
content generation, the mission also aims to promote research in critical areas relating to imparting education to the masses.

In the present context, it has been felt that there is a need to extend the reach of the mission to the north-eastern states
of the country where reach ability of quality higher education is severely hampered due to unfriendly terrains, societal
orientations, etc.As the first step in this direction, the Centre for Technology Enabled Learning (CTEL) has been set up in
the NIT Meghalaya Campus, which will allow teachers to develop content, spread awareness in various regions of the north-
east, and join the national initiative in a big way. The Centre strives to become the gateway of the north-east to achieve the
goals of the national mission.

A state-of-the-art studio has been set up in the centre where facilities for both content creation and content distribution
are being provided. Faculty members of the Institute as well eminent experts from other institutions and organizations are
being approached to develop technically high-quality video contents, which will be made available to the students through
on-line streaming technology. Through this studio, faculty members of NIT Meghalaya and also neighboring Institutes can
participate in developing contents and directly assist in national initiatives like NPTEL and SWAYAM.
