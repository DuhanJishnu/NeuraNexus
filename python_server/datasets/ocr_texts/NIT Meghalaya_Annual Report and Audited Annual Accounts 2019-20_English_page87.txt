1. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE DEPARTMENT:

The Department of Physics with its induction has evolved by offering two years full time Master of Science programme.
The department has also progressed in furnishing the Doctor of Philosophy programme and so far, the degree has been
awarded to 2 nos. of aspirants. In addition, the department supports the engineering branches of the institute by floating
the foundation courses for B.Tech (It year) and advanced science electives for B.Tech (2"4 Year onwards) students. The
department is well equipped with experimental laboratories which make corroboration with classroom physics for both
undergraduate and post graduate level. The functionality and progressiveness of the department is accredited to young,
dynamic and potential faculty pool with necessary support from the staff.
