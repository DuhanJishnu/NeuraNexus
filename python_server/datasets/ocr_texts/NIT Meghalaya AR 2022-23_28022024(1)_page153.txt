Central Instruments Facility (CIF)

1. Brief Introduction to the CIF:

The quality and high-end research is greatly hindered due to
insufficient facilities presently available at the institute for
conducting experimental and characterization works for different
departments. Our faculties and students are taking help from
the facilities at IITs and CSIR laboratories located in far off
distance. Many times, it is not possible due to multifarious
unavoidable reasons. Keeping these issues in mind, the institute
has established a Central Instruments Facility (CIF) within the

workshop building in the permanent campus with necessary
high-end research tools and equipments (e.g. Powder X-Ray

Diffractometer, Fatigue Fracture Testing Machine, Field Emission

Scanning Electron Microscopy [FESEM], Metallic 3D printer etc)
for carrying out quality research and consultancy work in the
premises of the institute itself at the Permanent Campus at Sohra.
Considering the increasing numbers of the faculty members,
research scholars and the students who are aggressively engaged
in their research works, the CIF has been built up in 2021 and the
same was inaugurated on April 01, 2022 by the Director of the
Institute.
