Intangible Assets

E-Journals-% 1

A.4. The Institute during the year paid an amount of 2 1.27 crore for subscription to E-
Journals which were however booked under Administrative Expenses- Recurring expenses
for Departments instead of under Intangible Assets. This has resulted in understatement of
E-Journals by = 0.76 crore, Depreciation by = 0.51 crore and overstatement of Administrative

Expenses- Recurring expenses for Departments by = 1.27 crore. The Deficit for the year is

also overstated by = 0.76 crore.

Capital Work in Progress-% 311.05 crore.

A.5. The Institute during the year paid an amount of % 8.99 crore as advance to Contractors
for providing electricity supply and electrical works at the New Campus of the Institute which -
was booked under Capital Work in Progress. However, the Contractors were yet to start any
work as on 31.03.2023 against the advance paid. Hence, the Institute should have shown
the amount paid as Advances instead of Capital Work in Progress. This has resulted in

understatement of Advances and overstatement of Capital Work in Progress by = 8.99 crore.

Expenditure

Academic Expenses (Schedule- 16)

Recurring Contingency -% 20.74 lakh

B.1. The above head includes an amount of % 12.90 lakh being the amount paid to
NEEPCO Ltd. towards consultancy charges for construction of water storage at the Instituteâ€™s
Permanent Campus in Sohra. Since the expenditure was incurred by the Institute for
construction works, the same should have booked as Capital Expenditure and not as Revenue
Expenditure. The wrong booking of the expenses has resulted in overstatement of Academic

Expenses and understatement of Capital Work in Progress by = 12.90 lakh.
