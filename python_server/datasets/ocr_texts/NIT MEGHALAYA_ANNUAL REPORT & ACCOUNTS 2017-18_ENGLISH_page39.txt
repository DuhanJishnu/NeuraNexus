Department of Electrical
Engineering

1. Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Electrical Engineering started in 2010 with an annual intake of 30 students in B.Tech. program. Since inception,
the major objective of the department is to impart high quality education with strong impetus on latest technologies research and
innovation. Presently, the Department of Electrical Engineering offers 4 years B. Tech. program in Electrical and Electronics
Engineering (EEE) and 2 years M.Tech. program with specialization in Power & Energy Systems. Annually the admission intake
for B.Tech. and M.Tech. program are 30 and 20 students respectively. The Electrical Engineering Department have esteemed
and dedicated faculties with various specialization and expertise. At present, all faculties (except 2 faculties) are PhD in their
respective domain of research work and carry out research work in various fields. Further to add, there are 7 full time & few external
PhD scholars carrying out their research work under the supervision of faculties in the department. The major areas of research
include Smart Grid in Power System, Renewable Energy and its applications, Power Electronics & Drives, Control System and
Instrumentation, High Voltage Engineering etc. In addition, the department faculties received 6 nos. of sponsored projects from
various Govt. agencies and all these projects are in operation.

The department has 11 laboratories equipped with experimental and simulation facilities. The laboratories include Power System,
Control & Instrumentation, Electrical Machines, Electrical Drives, Power Electronics, Basic Electrical, Microprocessor, Network &
Systems, Digital Electronics, Digital Signal Processing and newly inducted High Voltage Lab. The experimental facilities are well
equipped with high end technologies for undergraduate and post graduate students and are available to students for their regular
courses, projects and research work. The laboratory facility also includes high end simulation software such as MATLAB, Power
Simulator (PSIM), Electro-Magnetic Transient Program (EMTP), PSS@E Network, FLUX and are utilized by undergraduate as well
as post graduate students.
