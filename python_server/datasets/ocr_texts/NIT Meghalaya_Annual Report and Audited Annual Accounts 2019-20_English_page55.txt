1. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE DEPARTMENT

The Department of Electrical Engineering started since the inception of NIT Meghalaya. Presently the department offers
B.Tech, M.Tech and Ph.D Programs. The B.Tech program started in 2010 with an intake of 30 students at NIT Surat and
since 2014 onward M.Tech program has been started with an intake of 20 students offering specialization in Power &
Energy Systems. Presently there are full time and part time research scholars, registered for the Ph.D program in diverse
specializations. The Department aims to impart high quality education to the students and carry out fundamental and
industry-oriented research work. The research interest of faculties encompasses various areas of electrical engineering
such as Power system Control, Smart Grid Technology, Synchrophasor Technology, Power Quality and Renewable energy
integration to grid, Power Electronics & Drives, Control System and Instrumentation, Signal Processing and Biomedical
Instrumentation, High Voltage Engineering etc. The department have well-equipped laboratory facilities to the students
such as Basic Electrical Engineering Lab, Electrical Machine Lab, Network and Systems Lab, Digital Electronics Lab, Power
System Lab, Computational Lab, Control & Instrumentation Lab, Power Electronics Lab, Electric Drives Lab, Microprocessor
Lab, Microcontroller & Embedded Systems Lab. Specialized simulation softwares like Matlab, Sincal, FLUX, PSPICE, PSIM,
PSS@E, EMYP etc. are available with the department to carry out experiments and research activities. Besides, faculty of EE
department are very actively publishing papers in reputed journals and conferences such as IEEE, IET, Elsevier, Springer, Taylor
and Francis, Wiley etc. Moreover, faculty members of EE department have received several sponsored research projects
from various agencies like SERB-DST, CPRI, REC and State Council of Science Technology & Environment (SCSTE, Govt. of
Meghalaya).
