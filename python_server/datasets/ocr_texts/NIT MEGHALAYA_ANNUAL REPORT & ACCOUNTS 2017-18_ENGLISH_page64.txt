Department of
Physics

1. Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Physics with its induction has evolved by offering two years full time Master of Science programme. The
department has also progressed in furnishing the Doctor of Philosophy programme and so far the degree has been awarded to
2 nos. of aspirants. In addition, the department supports the engineering branches of the institute by floating the foundation
courses for B.Tech (1st year) and advanced science electives for B.Tech (2nd Year) students. The department is well equipped
with experimental laboratories which make corroboration with classroom physics for both under graduate and post graduate level.
The functionality and progressiveness of the department is accredited to young, dynamic and potential faculty pool with necessary
support from the staff.
