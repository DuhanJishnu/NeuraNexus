Department of
Mathematics

1. Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Mathematics was established in 2012 with the inception of National Institute of Technology Meghalaya.
The department offers Ph.D. and 2 year-M.Sc. programme in Mathematics. The department also supports all the engineering
departments by offering undergraduate and postgraduate level courses in mathematics to the B.Tech and M. Tech students over a
number of semesters. The department has been organizing seminars and summer internship programs for students and research
scholars. The department has at present six regular faculty members. The faculties are actively engaged in research, teaching,
training and administrative work. The main objective of the department is to attract the students of science and engineering, and
to provide them academically coherent programmes, with courses that range from the fundamental to the advanced.
