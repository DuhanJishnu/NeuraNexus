Engineering

Brief Introduction to the Department:

The Department of Electrical Engineering offers the B. Tech program that was started in 2010 with an annual intake of
30. Department of Electrical Engineering is evolving since the inception of NIT Meghalaya in the year 2010. Presently, the
department is offering 8 Semester B.Tech Program with an intake capacity of 30. Since 2014 it has started M-The program with
intake of 20 students offering specialization in Power & Energy Systems. Currently in the department few full time Ph.D research
scholars are registered & few external candidates are also registered under different faculty members. The major objective of
the Department is to impart high quality education and research with a solid foundation in Electrical Engineering that prepares
them for life-long careers. The broad areas of expertise include Deregulated power system, Soft computing application in
power system control, Voltage stability alleviation under Deregulated Environment, Power Electronics & Drives, Control System
and Instrumentation, Mechatronics, Embedded System, Non-conventional Energy system etc. Softwareâ€™s like MATLAB, P-SIM,
EMTP,PSS@E Networkare available with the Department in order to accelerate the research. Almost all the laboratories such as
Electrical Machine Lab, Network and Systems lab, Digital Electronics Lab, Power System & Switchgear Protection Lab, Control
& Instrumentation Lab, Power Electronics & Drives Lab, Microprocessor & DSP Lab, are fully operational and also equipped with
latest instruments.
