# Repository Guidelines

- Always use absolute paths when interacting with the project files.
- Node server code is located under `node_server/src`. The main entry point appears to be `node_server/src/index.ts`.
- Client application is located under `client/` and is built with Next.js.
- Python server is located under `python_server/`.
- Prefer TypeScript for backend changes unless otherwise specified.
- Tests and linting commands should be run from the project root when needed.
